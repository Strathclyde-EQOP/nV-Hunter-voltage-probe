# nV-Hunter-voltage-probe

This repository contains design files for a high gain (80 dB, 10k), low bandwidth (0.1 - 200 Hz) voltage probe.

It was designed to allow testing of the [Vernier Current Driver](https://github.com/Strathclyde-EQOP/Vernier-Current-Driver).

## Releases

Checkout the [latest release](https://github.com/Strathclyde-EQOP/nV-Hunter-voltage-probe/releases/latest) to download the latest verified version of the design. Releases include PDF schematics and gerber files, so there is no need to install/understand KiCAD in order to make a board.

## Specification brief

- BW : 0.1 - 200 Hz
- RMS noise 38.1 nV 0.1 Hz - 5 MHz
- Peak-to-Peak noise 310.6 nV 0.1 Hz - 5 MHz
